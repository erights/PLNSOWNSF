The awful title stands for "PrivateName-like special object with
name-side faulting".

This is an exploration towards direct support for what is often
referred to as the WeakMap model of private state. This proposal
attempts to learn from
   * the current stage 3 private state proposal using `.#`
   * various threads exploring private symbols
   * @zenparsing's old `::` proposal
   * The reification of `PrivateName` in the decorator proposal.
